# USACO Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to various USACO (USA Computing Olympiad) problems implemented in Rust.

## Usage

To run a specific solution, navigate to the `bin` directory and execute the following command:
`cargo run --bin [file name without extention]`.

## Why is the code so... long?

The code here is about 4x longer than the answers on the guide mostly because I use a silly amount of functions, but the general idea is the same.
